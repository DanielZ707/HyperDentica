                Dental implants are small metal screws that are placed in the jaw so that crowns, bridges and dentures
                can be fixed onto them. Dental implants have one goal: to replace the gaps in missing teeth and improve
                oneâ€™s quality of life. We know the pains that missing teeth can have on your day, you may have avoided
                being in photos, tried not to smile amongst friends, or even stayed in the house to avoid anyone seeing
                you.

                Implant dentistry procedures offer a clinically proven and safe solution to getting back a great smile
                and being able to bite and chew with confidence. When you lose your natural teeth, your jaw bone and
                surrounding tissues start to resorb or disappear over time. When dental implants are placed in the jaw,
                it stimulates the remaining bone to grow and mesh around the metal, along with tiny blood vessels. More
                importantly, having a dental implant procedure can help to restore function so you can eat, chew and
                bite without your dentures falling out or having to stick to a soft food diet for the rest of your life.
