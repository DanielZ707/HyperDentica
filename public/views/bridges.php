                If you require a more extensive restoration than a crown or have more than one tooth that needs to be
                repaired, a good solution is a bridge. Bridges are usually made of a precious metal base which gives
                them a solid structure and makes them hard-wearing.

            <p>
                If you need a bridge in your smile line, porcelain is usually added to the base to make it look more
                like real teeth. A bridge helps to strengthen the prepared teeth and makes chewing and eating easier
                because they are fixed and canâ€™t come out.
            </p>

                Some bridges can also be fixed to your jaw with dental implants, if you have several teeth next to each
                other that are missing. Once you have a bridge fitted, you will have to take extra care of your daily
                hygiene regime to ensure it stays plaque free and that you can prevent bad breath.
