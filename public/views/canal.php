                Root canal treatment, also called Endodontics, is needed when the pulp inside your tooth becomes
                infected due to tooth decay or is damaged because of an injury to your mouth. This infection may spread
                through the root canal system, which could eventually lead to an abscess, causing a great deal of
                discomfort. Some teeth may darken in colour, which indicates that the nerve is dying (or has died).
                A root canal would be necessary in this case.

                There are several symptoms and signs that indicate you need a root canal treatment. It is necessary to
                perform a root canal if dental X-rays reveal that bacteria have destroyed the pulp inside a tooth. If
                the pulp is infected by bacteria, it can become inflamed, which allows the bacteria to multiply and
                spread. If root canal treatment is not carried out, the tooth may need to be taken out. Our dentists
                can perform root canal treatment to stop the infection from spreading and will preserve as much of your
                tooth as possible.
