                A dental check-up is a preventive measure that involves professional assessment of teeth, enamel
                quality, gums and calculus presence.
                It is recommended for a dental check-up to be performed once every six months.

                Preventive dentistry is the name we give to all the regular, day-to-day care we give our teeth and oral
                health, in order to protect our long-term oral health.
            </p>
            <p>
                As with all health issues, with dental care, prevention is better than a cure. The preventive measures
                we take, and encourage our patients to take, are all put in place to avoid intervention and restoration
                in the future.
