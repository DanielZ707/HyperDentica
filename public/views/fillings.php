                Made from a composite material that sets hard, white fillings are a durable solution
                with long-lasting results. If you do have decay and need a filling, then we recommend white fillings as
                a good solution that is both aesthetic and functional. If you already have traditional metal fillings,
                then you can replace silver fillings with white fillings.

                White dental fillings are a safe procedure that entails one of our dentists removing any decay from
                your tooth, taking out the metal or amalgam filling and placing a tooth coloured filling instead.
                The new filling is made from a very hard substance and will withstand the forces in your mouth when you
                bite and chew over a long period of time. This will allow you to smile without a metallic glint in
                sight, giving your teeth a more natural appearance overall. In addition, white fillings are identical
                to the tooth colour, making it virtually impossible to distinguish.
