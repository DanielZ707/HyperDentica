                Dental hygiene treatment is delivered by a dental hygienist who will help to remove any plaque from
                your teeth that may have built up in certain areas. Your teeth will be professionally cleaned with
                special equipment and pastes, this process is also known as scaling and polishing. An important
                aspect of the hygienistâ€™s role is to show you how to look after your teeth, so they remain free from
                plaque. You will be advised on the best brushing technique and given tips on flossing and using
                interdental brushes.
            </p>

                Dental hygiene at the dental practice also forms part of treating gum disease and bad breath. If you
                have a bridge, denture, orthodontic treatment or a dental implant you will have specific hygiene needs
                that the hygienist will be able to assist you with.
