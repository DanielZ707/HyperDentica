                Are your teeth stained, chipped, or not aligned on top of each other? Veneers are a good treatment
                option to consider because they look like natural teeth and don’t require a major procedure. Based on
                your needs, we can adjust the shape of your veneers to make your teeth overall look longer and/or
                closer together. For a single stained tooth, we can also match the precise shade of porcelain to give
                it a lighter appearance and fit in with the surrounding teeth.

                A veneer is a very thin, tooth-coloured piece of porcelain that is bonded on top of your own tooth.
                They appear natural and are a fantastic treatment option as they blend in with your natural teeth. The
                treatment is also very straightforward and requires minimal preparation, meaning that your teeth won’t
                need to be shaved down for the veneers. Veneers can also be used to close small gaps when braces are not
                suitable. You can have just one veneer or a whole set, known as a smile makeover. If one tooth is
                slightly out of position, a veneer can sometimes be fitted to bring it into line with the others.
