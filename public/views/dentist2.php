                Laureen graduated from the St. Bartholomew’s and Royal London Hospitals school of Medicine and Dentistry
                in 2006. Her areas of special interest include preventative, restorative and cosmetic dentistry, such as
                Invisalign orthodontics, and she regularly attends courses in these areas to keep herself at the
                forefront of treatment developments. Laureen enhances her patient’s dental experience with her caring
                and enthusiastic approach to dentistry. Outside of work she enjoys keeping fit by attending gym classes
                and being a regular swimmer.
