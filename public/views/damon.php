                The Damon Brace system is a revolutionary passive orthodontic treatment, which uses tieless brackets and high technology arch wires that are clinically proven to move teeth faster. It is a comfortable treatment that can provide spectacular smile and facial results in a much shorter time than conventional brace systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Conventional brace systems use elastic ties to hold the arch wires in place. These can cause fiction and pressure which can make treatment much slower and more uncomfortable. With Damon braces, their unique slide mechanism reduces friction which makes treatment quicker and more comfortable

                Damon Clear
            </p>
            <p>
                Damon Clear is a part of the Damon Brace system, and again uses a slide mecanis to elimante the need for elastic friction. The Clear Damon appliance is however made from a tooth coloured ceramic, to not only provide a fast and smooth treatment, but also with great aesthetics throughout.
