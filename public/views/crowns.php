                A crown is a type of dental restoration used to fix teeth that have been broken, weakened by decay or
                have a very large filling. The crown fits over the remaining part of a prepared tooth, making it strong
                and giving it the shape of a natural tooth. It will also be tooth coloured, giving the restoration a
                more natural appearance so it fits in with the rest of your teeth.
            </p>

                A crown could be a good solution for you if you have some discoloured fillings and would like to improve
                their appearance. Crowns can be used to replace these to give you a more aesthetic smile. Also, if you
                have had root canal treatment you will need a crown to protect or cap the restored tooth, allowing you
                to eat and bite down on it as if it was a real tooth. Crowns are also used to anchor a bridge or denture
                firmly in place in the mouth.
