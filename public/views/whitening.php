                Teeth whitening can be a good solution for certain types of tooth staining. Teeth can be stained by
                foods, drinks, smoking and certain medications. Teeth whitening is a safe procedure that can lighten the
                colour of your teeth by using a safe dental bleaching agent. Individual results vary and are based on
                your initial tooth colour and the nature of your tooth staining.

                We deliver two types of teeth whitening:
            </p>
            <p style="font-weight: bold">
                1. Power Whitening
            </p>
            <p>
                Here your teeth are whitened in the dental chair. A protective barrier is placed on
                your gums and lips, and a gel is placed on your teeth. A lamp is positioned over the teeth and this
                activates the bleaching process. After one hour you can expect your teeth to look a few shades brighter.
            <p style="font-weight: bold">
                2. Home Whitening
            </p>
            <p>
                Here we custom-make a lightweight
                plastic mouth tray for you that fits snugly over your teeth. You then put a whitening gel inside the
                tray and wear it at night or for a few hours during the day. Results are normally seen over 2 weeks and
                your teeth will also appear whiter and brighter.
